This document is the Personal Software Process (PSP) Requirements Statement 
for the htmled sub-project Handbook parts 2 blogger manual posts. It defines 
in a clear and unambiguous way the requirements for this sub-project.

1. Based on the existing htmled program, make a program that processes a real 
   Handbook file and extracts its information into a tree of DailyEntries and 
   SubjectEntries objects.

2. It must be possible to extract selected well formed posts from these entries 
   for easy, although manual posting them in a blogger (www.blogger.com) 
   weblog.

3. I'll be the primary user of this htmled project and I want to use it to 
   make posting to my two weblogs - idiota and Argonaut's Life - from my 
   corresponding Handbooks easier. A requirement is therefore to make the next 
   update of the blogs with the htmled system.

4. A "well formed post" extracted from a SubjectEntry has a title, a name for 
   HTML referencing and contents in HTML format (not full document) without 
   "newline" characters.
